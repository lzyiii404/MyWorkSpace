2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.040 ns between led0/cnt_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz) and led0/cnt_reg[21]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.045 ns between led0/cnt_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz) and led0/cnt_reg[23]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.061 ns between led0/cnt_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz) and led0/cnt_reg[24]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.140 ns between led0/cnt_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz) and led0/cnt_reg[25]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Rst_n relative to clock(s) Clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[0] relative to clock(s) Clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[1] relative to clock(s) Clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[2] relative to clock(s) Clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[3] relative to clock(s) Clk
Related violations: <none>
